# Confidential Digital Passport

A revolutionary privacy-preserving digital identity system that transforms how personal information is managed and verified on the blockchain.

## üîê Core Concepts

### FHE Smart Contracts
Our system leverages **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** smart contracts powered by Zama's cutting-edge cryptographic technology. These contracts enable computations on encrypted data without ever decrypting sensitive information, ensuring absolute privacy protection.

### Confidential Digital Passport - Privacy Digital Identity
The confidential digital passport represents a new paradigm in digital identity management where:
- Personal data remains encrypted at all times
- Identity verification occurs without exposing actual values
- Users maintain complete control over their information
- Zero-knowledge proofs enable selective disclosure

## üöÄ Key Features

**Privacy-First Architecture**
- All personal data encrypted using FHE technology
- Age verification without revealing actual age
- Nationality confirmation without exposing citizenship details
- Granular permission system for data access control

**Decentralized Identity Management**
- Government authorities can issue secure digital passports
- Citizens control verification permissions
- Organizations request access to specific data points
- Blockchain-based transparency and immutability

**Advanced Cryptographic Protection**
- Encrypted personal information storage
- Computation on encrypted data
- Zero-knowledge verification protocols
- Privacy-preserving identity proofs
